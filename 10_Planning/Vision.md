# 🌌 Vision: Synapso

**Synapso** is a local-first, privacy-aware semantic knowledge engine designed for thinkers, builders, and lifelong learners.  
Our goal is to make powerful AI-backed personal search and memory tools accessible — without sacrificing user agency or data ownership.

---

## 🎯 Core Mission

To empower individuals with **fast, intelligent, and private search** across their own notes and documents — using lightweight, local-first tooling.

---

## 🔑 Guiding Principles

- **Local-first by default**: All data lives on your machine. Cloud is opt-in, not assumed.
- **Minimal setup, maximal value**: Synapso should feel like magic without needing 20 steps of configuration.
- **Semantic-native**: Search not just for keywords, but meaning. Your system should understand your thoughts.
- **Extensible and transparent**: Users can inspect, customize, or swap any component — from vector stores to models.
- **Modular interfaces**: CLI-first with clean APIs. UI and automation layers come later, but never dictate the core logic.

---

## 🛠️ Who is it for?

- Developers and researchers who use Obsidian, Notion, or plaintext note systems
- Engineers who want fast semantic recall without sending data to OpenAI
- Writers, students, and tinkerers who value long-term memory and autonomy
- Anyone tired of forgetting what they already figured out

---

## 🌱 Long-Term Vision

We believe every user deserves:

- A **second brain** that runs locally and semantically understands you
- A **Cortex** of ideas that grows over time — searchable, explorable, and private
- A world where **you own your knowledge**, not a cloud provider

---

> Synapso is not a note-taking app. It’s a _thinking layer_ — built to remember, reason, and retrieve.

---

## 📌 MVP Goals

- CLI-based Cortex registration and indexing
- Support for `.md` and `.txt` files
- Local vector storage via `pgvector` (Postgres)
- Markdown-powered developer logs and architecture
- Modular design to support plug and play
	- Actual plug and play not required.

---

## 🔭 What comes next?

- Cross-device sync via secure opt-in cloud
- Full-text + semantic hybrid search
- In-app visual exploration of ideas and clusters
- Plugin-based reranking, filters, and memory shaping
